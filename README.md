# rectx
A quick and easy to use project manager for ReCT programming language based projects.

The ReCT programming language was created by RedCubeDev, and originally a ByteSpace project.
Currently, the language is multiple compilers, package systems, and projects that may be intimidating.
ReCTx tries to simplify projects by automatically setting up everything you will need in your ReCT journey!

### Features
- **Project generation**: generate project directory and settings based on different profiles to choose from.
- **Easily build and run projects**: building and running are as simple as `rectx build` or `rectx run`!
