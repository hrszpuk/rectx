## :warning: This project has been archived :warning:
This project relied on the ReCT programming language's development as it is designed to be used with either rgoc or rctc (rect compilers).
Since these compilers are no longer being maintained I have decided to archive the project.
This project is still licensed under GPLv3 for anyone wishes to continue its development.
