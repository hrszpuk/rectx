## Supported Versions

Prior to v2.0.0 development, the codebase of this project was written in Rust. 
A complete rewrite has been put into effect for v2.0.0 which means the entire project is being rewritten in Go.
For this reason, v2.0.0 is the only version currently supported as putting resources and effort into older, entirely different codebases is not feasible.
